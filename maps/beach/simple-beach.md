# Simple Beach Map

A stretch of sandy beach meeting calm, shallow waters dotted with three rocky islets. Perfect for coastal skirmishes and amphibious assaults.

## Key Terrain

- **Sandy Shore**  
  Flat, open ground—movement is easy but offers no cover.

- **Shallow Waters**  
  Half-cover at waist height; movement reduced by 1 square.

- **Rocky Islets**  
  Three craggy outcrops (large, medium, small) that grant full cover and an elevated firing position.

## Tactical Points

| Feature       | Benefit                 | Risk                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Eastern Islet | High ground (+1 to hit) | Exposed flanks          |

| Western Shore | Clear line of retreat   | Open to ranged attacks  |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **Beachhead Assault**  
   Defenders hold the eastern islet—attackers must wade through water under arrow fire.

2. **Artifact Recovery**  
   A magical obelisk stands on the central rock; both sides race to control it.

3. **Night Skirmish**  
   Dim lanterns reveal only outlines—stealth and surprise are key.
