### 🌟 **Key Features & Areas**

#### 🏯 **Longhouse** _(Top Center)_

The heart of Felder House, this grand hall provides shared living quarters with ample beds, a large feast table, and cozy fireside seating. Ideal for party meetings, downtime RP, or entertaining important guests.

#### 🍺 **Mystical Tavern** _(North of Main Road, Lakeside)_

A magical watering hole with glowing arcane energy at the entrance. A more eclectic and mystical vibe than its sibling tavern, it’s a hotspot for shady deals, rumors, and bardic tales.

#### 🔪 **Butcher & Tanner**

- The **Butcher** processes game and livestock into meat and hides.
- The **Tanner** transforms those hides into armor or trade goods. The scent is pungent, but the results are invaluable for leather gear.

#### 🔨 **Smithy**

An essential crafting station where weapons are forged and armor repaired. Flames constantly flicker from the forge, and the anvil rings with steady hammering.

#### 🧍 **Sasashi**

A small private structure—possibly the home or shop of a named NPC or companion. Could be a quest-giver or specialized artisan.

#### ⛪ **Azheim Shrine**

A solemn and ancient place of worship. Statues and offerings suggest it's dedicated to Azheim, a deity of wisdom, protection, or memory. Perfect for cleric rituals, divine intervention, or resting sacred relics.

#### 🏘️ **Felder Senior House**

A quiet residence set apart from the bustle. This is likely the namesake's home—perhaps a retired adventurer or the party's original benefactor.

#### 🌠 **Wish Shop**

A magical boutique for scrolls, charms, or hard-to-find components. The name implies risk and reward—perhaps literal wish spells for the daring.

#### 🍷 **Proper Tavern** _(Bottom Left)_

A polished, orderly tavern with private rooms and a rear stable. This establishment caters to nobility, travelers, and mercantile contacts—business deals happen here.

#### 🐂 **Livestock & Wagons**

- Two oxen graze near heavy-duty wagons—ready for supply runs, evacuations, or trade expeditions.
- Multiple carts and a stable near the Proper Tavern support travel and overland logistics.

#### 🛡️ **Watch Post**

A wooden lookout tower ensures eyes are always on the horizon, providing security from bandits or monsters.

#### 🌳 **Lake & Old Tree** _(Top Left)_

A natural reservoir with a dock and a gnarled old tree. Possibly the site of old magic, druidic rituals, or the village's founding story. The perfect place for quiet moments or nature-based spells.
